Datasets and R tutorials for making visualisations of Scottish football


This is just a page where I'll post the code I use to create the various data visualisations I share on my Twitter (same @ as here) and share some of the datasets I've collected. I learned the basics of these plot styles from FC R Stats but have put my own twist on them with colour schemes, annotations etc. so hopefully you find something useful in here.
