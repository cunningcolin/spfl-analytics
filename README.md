Datasets and R tutorials for making visualisations of Scottish football


This is just a page where I'll post the code I use to create the various data visualisations I share on my Twitter (same @ as here) and share some of the datasets I've collected. I learned the basics of these plot styles from FC R Stats but have put my own twist on them with colour schemes, annotations etc. so hopefully you find something useful in here.



## Player xG v xA Scatterplot

This was the first plot I learned to code in R and is probably the most common you'll see on Football Analytics Twitter. Modern Fitba have kindly allowed me to share their dataset from the 20/21 Scottish Premiership season

I start my session by loading the following packages, although some of them may be overkill

`library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(formattable)
library(tidyr) 
library(htmltools)
library(webshot)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra) 
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
library(ggpubr)`
